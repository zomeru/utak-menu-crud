# CRUD App Documentation

## Overview

This CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application was developed using Vite + React for the frontend and Firebase for backend services. The application allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on menu items.

## Technologies Used

- **Vite + React**: Vite was used as the build tool and development server. It provided fast builds and hot module replacement during development.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Tailwind CSS was utilized for styling the UI components. Its utility-first approach allowed for rapid styling and customization.
- **Fuse.js**: Fuse.js was integrated into the application to implement client-side full-text search functionality. This allows users to efficiently search for menu items based on their name or category.

## Features

- **Basic CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete menu items.
- **Image Upload**: Although not originally required (based on instructions), the application includes a feature for uploading images for menu items using Firebase Storage. This adds visual appeal and enhances the user experience.
- **Full-text Search**: The application incorporates client/browser-side full-text search functionality using Fuse.js. This allows users to quickly search for menu items by name or description without reloading the page.
